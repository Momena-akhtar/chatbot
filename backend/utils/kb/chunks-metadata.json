    "Q. I'd appreciate it if you could share your Slack and Trello workflow with me.\n\nA. Slack - client communication\n- Paid version\n- ⁠client added to guest channel\n- ⁠Csm and ppc specialist added\n\nClickUp - internal communication\n- every client has a separate card or task\n- ⁠under sub tasks we add marketplaces or if it’s just one marketplace then we add the type of ads like SP, SBV, SD, HSA",
    "Q. Why do you recommend using ClickUp for internal communication instead of Slack?\n\nA. Clickup is a project/account management software so slack will only be limited to internal communication whereas clickup can quickly show you:\n- What is happening with an account or project\n- What stage we are in and where we are stuck\n- What has happened so far (history from activity log)\n- What are the high level goals",
    "Q. Which tools are needed to become an expert salesman?\n\nA. Not tools but I would recommend some skills that play a crucial role in becoming a good closer.\n\n1- Active Listening\n2- Art of asking good probing questions.\n\nAnything after that is just a conversation.",
    "Q. Any tool or platform recommendation to organize SOPs and videos?\n\nA. Use Loom for recordings and then Framewise to make a course out of it.\n\nThe course is recent. We’ve done it for 3 departments so far.\n\nNow anyone who joins our team goes through the training and has to pass the test.\n\nAnd since everyone is commission/bonus based in our team, we don’t care how long it takes them to finish the training",
    "Q. What softwares can we utilize to manage PPC on Amazon?\n\nA. Adbrew",
    "Q. Is there any app to secure Excel sheets and prevent data theft?\n\nA. You can go back to previous versions of different sheets and even move them back from the trash folder.\n\nBut also create a backup of the sheets",
    "Q. I have a set offer in mind for managing a single product, but when a client comes with multiple products, I often struggle with pricing. Is there a formula?\n\nA. There is no formula, just look at % of work load that goes up and add that % on your price for single product",
    "Q. When and how is the best way to ask clients for video testimonials?\n\nA. Once a project is done, or if it is account based then on your monthly review, ask them how their experience is/was. If they are happy, say that you can give them 10% off on their next order/month if they give you a video testimonial",
    "Q. If another agency or freelancer refers a client to you, what percentage of revenue should I share with them?\n\nA. Here is my take on this:\n\nReferral = 10%-15%\nThat is how much your Marketing should cost anyway\n\nWhitelabel = 25% discount\nBecause now they also took away sales from you\n\nBut if you are a freelancer and have no sales team, then 20% isn’t a lot.\n\nWould you rather have some profit that others refer to or not have that profit at all?\n\nThe only reason you should choose the latter is if your entire team is already at capacity",
    "Q. I do architecture and interior design and want to refer clients for websites and branding to a friend. How much commission should I demand?\n\nA. Yeah you can ask hey do you guys have an affiliate program for any clients we pass on?\n\nLet him come back with a number and respect that.\n\nYou can always shop around for the best deal.\n\nBest deal has 3 components:\n- Referral %\n- ⁠Avg Deal size\n- ⁠Satisfaction rate (can be gauged from reviews)",
    "Q. Is it recommended to create a company page on a personal LinkedIn profile, or should we set up a separate profile?\n\nA. Create separate.\n\nThe one that you want to grow is the personal. People like following other people.\n\nCompany profile is only to show that there are real people behind the company page and you have some social presence",
    "Q. What factors determine the pricing tiers in each deck?\n\nA. The pricing tiers work to counter negotiations.\n\nExample:\n1. PPC only - $1k/mo\n2. ⁠ppc + account management - $1.5k/mo\n3. ⁠full store management - $2k/mo\n\nSo if client says i only have a budget of $1k, we tell them tier 1 is probably most suited for them\nAgain if there is a lot of confusion around pricing, give me a specific example and i can guide you on how to package it with a preset pricing model.",
    "Q. Is this the right time to post lead magnets and post about our skill by targeting specific sellers on LinkedIn?\n\nA. Just lead magnet. Don’t post about your skill.\n\nNo selling in posts. Add a CTA in your lead magnet. Only filtered people will book a call",
    "Q. Can you share some resources to learn more about Automatic Client Funnel by Alen Sultenic?\n\nA. I highly recommend joining (Never Held Back) NHB + when am there that time it was $500 a month not sure how much it is now\n\nHere is your roadmap\n\nLearn for free from NHB posts on fb\n\njoin Josh Gavin offer group $15 a month and learn low ticket offers\n\nConsider my community as we have some people from NHB group too explore inner circle nomads.com\n\nOnce you cross $3000+ month then join NHB+ or Fast forward their premium extension\n\nAC funnel is Alen’s flagship so u can best learn from NHB+\nAbove steps I shared based on your income goals",
    "Q. What should be a roadmap for me to grow from here with $500 budget? My niche is Amazon.\n\nA. I think for now just focus on one medium. $500 is a good budget to spend fully on Upwork.\n\nYou can allocate $250/mo in the first 1 month and ramp up from there.\n\nIn case there aren’t enough jobs, we can figure out the rest.\n\nIt is easier to focus and get one lead gen working vs trying multiple things and getting average results",
    "Q. How do we analyze the marketing strategies of our competitors?\n\nA. Just search what they are doing on google, yt, linkedin, ig.\n\nFollow the owners too.\n\nYou’ll know in general what they are doing.",
    "Q. My competitors are running ads and I wanted to know how many sale they are generating on SAAS Product. is there any way?\n\nA. That's the wrong approach.\n\nIf they are running google ads let's say, just look at the keywords and then go through their sales process, find their pricing.\n\nAll you have to know is:\n- They run ads on these keywords\n- Their sales process (e.g. form > calendar > call)\n- Their pricing\n\nAnd then you reverse engineer that and build it for your agency",
    "Q. I'm doing LinkedIn outreach with 5 Messages sequences after 3 days. Is this the right approach?\n\nA. If someone says no, you can message:\n\n- Thanks for letting me know. I'll take you off my list for now. We'll touch base in a few months to see if it makes sense for us to connect on a call\n\nThey will appreciate that.\n\nYou can put a follow up reminder for 2 months.\n\n5 message sequence ideally should be like this:\n\nMessage 1 (2 days gap)\nMessage 2 (3 days gap)\nMessage 3 (5 days gap)\nMessage 4 (7 days gap)\nMessage 5",
    "Q. I am starting outreaching my Ideal profiles. Is my strategy good?\n\nA: Your strategy seems solid. Engaging with content relevant to your target, such as liking or commenting on their posts, helps establish rapport.\n\nWhen sending connection requests, it’s great to mention something specific they’ve shared or spoken about to show genuine interest.\n\nIf there’s no response, following up with a casual message that provides context to your offer — without being too pushy — keeps things light and non-intrusive.\n\nOffering value, like sharing presentation samples, adds a personal touch and opens the door for further conversation. Keep it authentic, professional, and not too salesy.",
    "Q. I need a way out for approaching influencers and how to keep the bounce rate lower. Do I mail them via professional domain email or just sliding into their DMs would work?\n\nA. Do both. Try to use a secondary domain if the list is bigger than 1000.\n\nYou need to keep it vague and make them feel like it's a great opportunity.\n\nHey Influencer,\n\nSome personalization (I loved the video you did about XYZ). We work with quite a few brands on Amazon that are looking to work with influencers/brand promoters.\n\nAre you open to a partnership or collaboration? I can send you more details",
    "Q. What's the fixed cost (salaries + tools) you are paying for the complete email marketing process?\n\nA. We are paying our partner $2000/mo for this.\n\nIt has been 2 months so far. They helped us:\n- Write the email templates\n- Got us setup on Smartleads\n- Warmed up the domains\n- Scraped leads from Clay, Apollo and then further refined the list\n\nThe only other cost was for domains, we purchased around 40.\n\nOur goal is to get to 100K emails/month",
    "Q. How many emails you send to get conversation of 3 deals?\n\nA. I summarized it here. 12K emails to get 3 conversions.",
    "Q. What are the general points or mistakes to avoid in email copy that increase the chances of campaign success?\n\nA. - Avoid links in the first email as it impacts deliverability. Instead use screenshot of a case study OR say that you have an audit prepared for them\n- The goal is to get handraisers. Handraisers are basically people who express their interest by saying yes to whatever you offer. That's why audit works best because you get a yes\n- Keep it short. Make it more about the outcome, less about who you are. No one cares about you\n- That is one way to do it. You lead with a pain point and then mention the offer. However, so many people do this so you wanna ask to give them something free of cost that is valuable (e.g. audit that shows how they can grow sales by 20%)\n- Guidelines already mentioned\n- Calendly will be in second email to handraisers",
    "Q. For your AMZ website, how often do you track SEO KPIs?\n\nA. Every week we have a marketing call where we track everything.\n\nYou guys should also get into the habit of doing weekly calls.\n\nWe do separate calls with new marketing efforts. Example: Cold emails, we have a separate call with the team running it",
    "Q. What are the right metrics to track for SEO?\n\nA.\n- Total traffic\n- Specific service page and home page traffic\n- Kw position on your top 10-20 keywords\n- Domain authority\n- ⁠backlinks\n\nThese are the ones that you should focus on.\n\nAnd for inputs just focus on no of blogs per month and backlinks",
    "Q. What are your platform recommendations for booking most calls?\n\nA. Seo\nGoogle ads\nFb ads\nPartnerships\nConferences\nLinkedin outreach\nCold email\nNewsletters (new)\n\nPreffered ones are:\nSeo\nPartnerships\n\nBut you need to be really good and sometimes unique to do well from those channels",
    "Q. How can I shift from transition to Pitch?\n\nA. You need a deck.\n\nClients don’t care what type of deck it is.\n\nHow you get the info from them and then put that into the deck is more important.\n\nWhen showing examples, tell a story behind the deck.\n\nDon’t say it looks professional or elegant because that’s calling your work amazing.\n\nQ: Suggestions on stats? In the past 30 days, we’ve sent 68 proposals, 16 viewed, 12 interviews, and 2 hires. Can you derive a formula?\n\nA: Here’s the breakdown:\n\nProposal-to-View Rate: 23.5% (16/68)\n\nView-to-Interview Rate: 75% (12/16)\n\nInterview-to-Hire Rate: 16.7% (2/12)\n\nKey Formula:\nProposal-to-View Rate = Proposals Viewed/Proposals Sent\n\nView-to-Interview Rate = Interviews/Proposals Viewed\n\n​Interview-to-Hire Rate = Hires/Interviews\n\nAction Points:\nFocus on View-to-Interview for better engagement.\n\nImprove Interview-to-Hire for better closing.\n\nYour Cost per Acquisition is $150, well under your $1,440 ceiling, so you're in a good spot.\n\nScale fast, don’t over-optimize, and give new processes time to work (3 months minimum).",
    "Q. I am talking to a prospect with low sales who wants full account management but won't pay more than $1500/mo. How should I approach this?\n\nA. Sometimes closing deals at a lower price can be worth it if you see long-term potential. For example, I recently closed a $1k deal + 5% revenue share, locking them into a 1-year contract with clear deliverables (1 listing per month for creatives). It's important to set expectations—don’t let them expect multiple listings for the same price.\n\nAnother example: A client wanted a $30k app but only had $10k. We countered with $12k for an MVP, and as they generate revenue, we’ll handle future phases. This way, we didn’t lose the deal or overcommit resources.\n\nKey takeaway: Negotiate deliverables, not just price. Understand their budget, offer something within that range, and show them what they could get at a higher price. Think of it like showing your Ferrari collection—but offering an S-Class Mercedes too. It’s their choice.",
    "Q. Clients say we don’t know you as it’s also risky for us to do all upfront payment. How to deal with this issue?\n\nA. Give them a payment plan but collect something upfront. Use my strategy\n\nLike $2.5K if you pay upfront or $3K if you want to do it in 2 payments\n\nIf you guys go through my content and really practice the framework for sales, you will build enough value where even if they don't know your company, they will trust you after the call.\n\nI jump on calls where they are like who is AMZ One Step? But after talking to me for 10 mins, they know I am an expert and their money is nothing special for me.",
    "Q. What's the ideal approach for audit of a brand you want to propose a service to?\n\nA. If you are trying to pitch amazon ads, then 1 listing’s audit will be the initial loom you sent.\n\nIf they like what you presented then you can offer a comprehensive audit which you can get by them sending you the reports",
    "Q. In one of the videos, Saddam mentioned using software for client reporting. What kind of software is he referring to?\n\nA. He is still doing manual reporting.\n\nIf that was for Amazon PPC, he was referring to Adbrew. We manage the ads and reporting through that software",
    "Q. Is there any rule of thumb to check if we are hiring more staff than needed in an agency?\n\nA. 33% team, 33% marketing & sales and 33% profit. This is the ideal for agencies.",
    "Q. How much stripe charges and what are their deductions criteria?\n\nA. They charge around 3%\n\nIt’s based on the card the client is using.\n\nFor example Amex is higher than others",
    "Q. At your agency, do you guys hire freshers with little or no experience?\n\nA. We used to. Now that we are fully commission based I only hire experienced talent.\n\nThey don’t need much training and can usually bring initiatives from other companies and improve our internal processes",
    "Q. Fully commission based? Is it a viable offer for employees?\n\nA.\nYeah we face this in our design team a lot.\n\nBut we are providing a job to them and we explain what our avg employee makes in their department.\n\nThey will at least try it out. There should be potential for them to earn a lot. Well, most of the agencies would prefer a commission based model. It's an ideal one, but we have 10% people with such a mindset. If one truly understands, this could be beneficial for both.\n\nFor example our avg ad account billing is $500-$750/mo\n\nWe give our specialists\n- 15% of billing in first 4 months\n- ⁠30% of billing after that\n\nBefore they could manage 7-8. But now that we have a team of killers, they can manage 15.\n\n15% x 15 x $500 = $1125 (minimum)\n30% x 15 x $750 = $3375 (max)\n\nWho wouldn’t want this role in Pakistan\n\nIt’s all about finalizing the 3 best candidates and then educating them on this offer.\n\nMaybe 2 will say no, but 1 will definitely say yes",
    "Q. Which PPC Automation software are you using for managing these numbers of accounts or are all being done manually?\n\nAd brew, which is better than Scale insights\n\nI created all the automations myself.\n\nNow i sell that to low budget clients at $1000\n\nFull automation system to manage your own ppc in 4 hrs/wk\n\nWe also include 4 months of software in it. This way they are dependent on us",
    "Q. How do you set up KPI bonuses in your agencies?\n\nA. KPI’s are performance indicators - they should be correlated to performance i.e revenue or profit increase.\n\n% of revenue can be shared on work load managed.",
    "Q. I've been hiring on and off, always 1:1 interview. How do I conduct effective group interviews?\n\nA. In Pak, show up rate is bad so:\n\n- always schedule an extra candidate for interview because 1-2 won’t show (book 5 and 4 will show)\n- ⁠Give them a call and text on the day and ask for confirmation\n- ⁠send them a calendar invite through calendly or something that has 2 reminders",
    "Q. I am hiring an email marketing and LinkedIn expert for lead generation. What model would be win-win?\n\nA. So their main goal is to generate meetings.\n\nI would advertise the job as a 1 lakh+ salary.\n\nStructure:\nBase: 30k (as Husein mentioned)\nPer meeting booked: 10k\n\nTell them the goal is to book 10-15 meetings in a month.\n\nWith 10 meetings they can earn 130k\n\nOut of 10 meetings, you should close 2-3 clients.\n\nSo depends on your service if 2-3 clients will generate enough revenue so that 130k is around 10% of billing",

    "Q. Ideally how long should a group interview be?\n\nA. I book 45 min slots. With 4 candidates that’s the ideal time.\n\nAnd try to rotate. If you asked 1 person a question first, make them go last for the next question.",
    "Q. Is my group interview approach based on technical questions or soft skills good?\n\nA. It depends on the type of role you are hiring for. The more managerial it is, the more I try to ask them about the problems that I am facing in my company.\n\nI wanna hear how they will fix it for me.\n\nIf it’s entry level then I want to give them an assignment first and then ask them questions around that.",

    "1. Strong Systems & Policies\n- If your systems and policies are strong, you won't need intense management.\n- Example: \"Our Karachi team has nearly 100 people. We don't have a general manager, and yet the team runs smoothly.\"\n- Everyone is empowered to act as a leader and manage their responsibilities.\n2. Focus on Systems, Not Just People\n- When someone underperforms, examine the system first—it may be the system failing, not the individual.\n- A good system naturally drives employees to perform better.\n- Often when someone underperforms, people blame the employee. But many times, it's the system that's failing.\n3. Create Clear SOPs\n- Step 1: Write it down in simple language even a child could understand\n- Step 2: Record video demonstrations using tools like Loom\n- Step 3: Conduct live training sessions before assigning tasks\n- When SOPs are followed correctly, the success rate of task completion drastically improves.\n4. Establish Clear Policies\n- Create an online manual as part of onboarding\n- Conduct regular reinforcement sessions\n- Maintain consistency—avoid making exceptions\n- Use templates customized to your company culture\n- If you're constantly needing to make exceptions, either the policy is too strict or too weak—adjust accordingly.\n5. Culture of Celebrations\n- Celebrate wins, even small ones\n- Publicly appreciate top performers\n- Avoid focusing solely on mistakes\n- Create healthy competition through recognition\n- In places like Pakistan, it's common to ignore good performance but highlight mistakes instantly—this creates a toxic environment.\n6. Trust Your Team\n- Constantly asking for proof, hovering over your team, or double-checking everything kills initiative.\n- Trust builds accountability and performance.\n- Stop micromanaging—it kills initiative.",
    "- CSMs act as the bridge between your agency and clients, ensuring smooth communication.\n- Designers, ad managers, and copywriters may lack client-facing skills, making CSMs invaluable.\n- Hiring CSMs is lower-risk since they typically don’t require specialized technical skills or large teams.",

    "- Taking Profits Too Early: New owners often extract profits too soon instead of reinvesting in marketing for growth.\n- Trying to Do Everything: Many try to handle all tasks themselves, believing they know everything.\n- Growth Stagnation: Agencies can experience initial growth but quickly plateau without continued marketing investment.\n- Limiting Beliefs: Many stop trying new strategies based on past experiences, limiting their potential growth.\n- Overextension: Avoid spreading yourself too thin by trying to manage multiple domains simultaneously (e.g., SEO, PPC, etc.).

Handle rejection gracefully without being pushy (e.g., \"I understand this may not be the right time—thank you for listening.\").\n3. Offer free value upfront (e.g., \"We’d love to create one free video for you to showcase our expertise.\").",
    "Key Steps for Effective Cold Email Campaigns:\n1. Use lead generation tools like Clay to find prospects efficiently.\n2. Send emails via platforms like SmartLead while using multiple domains (limit: ~30 emails/day per domain) to avoid spam filters.\n3. Create 3–4 email templates with these elements:\n- Personalization (mention their business name or recent achievements).\n- Social proof (highlight past successes or testimonials).\n- A soft call-to-action (e.g., “Would you be open to a quick chat?”).\n4.

    "Q.Which company/way is recommended for buying an email list?\n\n1. You can use Apollo, Sales Nav, etc\n2. ⁠Google Amazon FBA leads or whatever industry and buy from websites\n3. ⁠Google/check fb groups for agencies that do DFY lead gen\n4. ⁠Hire a VA to create lists for you\n\nProbably 1 and 2 are the easiest ones. 3 can be expensive. 4 needs time to build yourself",
    "Q. If we use Google Amazon FBA, do they sell the same lead list to other agencies as well and how to make sure that they are not providing dead lists?\n\nA. Yes they do sell to others.\n\nMost of these companies give you a sample list.\n\nYou can check email validation tools to make sure they are not bouncing. However, you won’t know if they are dead leads until you start reaching out. Even one lead converted can pay off the investment.",

Things have changed so I will share some results with you guys in a month.\n\nFor now, if you are doing more than $10k/mo, I think you guys should at least try Google Ads.\n\nIf we can get 5 agency owners to spend $1000/mo for 2 months, we can collectively crack the code on Google ads. Right now, we get about 100 leads/mo spending $8k/mo on Google ads.",
    "Q. What's the conversion rate for Google Ad leads?\n\nA. 1 out of 3. But you guys should consider 1 out of 5 because it takes time to optimize your sales funnel",
    "Q. I spent around 8K$ on google ADS Q4 last year and didn't get a single lead.\nA. Not a single lead? Must have been a funnel issue.\n\nOnce we get 5 or more agencies to participate, here is what we will do:\n\n- We'll review everyone's landing page\n- Give you pointers on how to select keywords to target\n- Ensure CTA is properly optimized > VSL, Collecting info, calendar booking\n- Guide you to create CRM setup\n- Ensure your initial workflow is setup in CRM > Goal is to book a call for those who haven't\n- Ensure call show up workflow is setup in Calendly > Goal is for prospect to show up",

I have 1 basic level person who can handle basic stuff of the process. What should be a roadmap for me to grow from here? My niche is Amazon.\n\nI think for now just focus on one medium. $500 is a good budget to spend fully on Upwork.\n\nYou can allocate $250/mo in the first 1 month and ramp up from there.\n\nIn case there aren’t enough jobs, we can figure out the rest.\n\nIt is easier to focus and get one lead gen working vs trying multiple things and getting average results",

Opportunities come in small windows, you need to act on them removing any bias of what you believe your identity is.\n\nWhat you currently do is just a means to fulfill your deeper purpose. So if this opportunity will help you fulfill your deeper purpose, I would say consider it.\n\nThat being said, financially it should make sense.\nWhat are they offering?",
    "Q. I’m stuck in a situation where a client is not making a decision just because his partner has not approved it. How to tackle this?\n\nAgreed.

    "Q. An Upwork client wants us to do A+ content for his 4 Parent listings. How should I price this?\nA. Hey Client name,\n\nHere is a breakdown of the scope and our proposed price.\n\nProject Overview:\n- Designing 4 parent listing images.\n- Each parent listing has a total of 35 child variations.\n- Listing 1: 5 variations\n- Listing 2: 3 variations\n- Listing 3: 4 variations\n- Listing 4: 23 variations\n- Our strategy involves creating 4 parent EBC designs and customizing them to suit the individual child variations. We will allocate 30% of the design to accommodate the unique features of each child variation, ensuring a cohesive yet tailored approach.\n\nProject Proposal:\n- Total Bid: $900\n- Timeline: 4-5 weeks for completion\n\nBilling Method:\n- We propose to use Upwork's hourly payment system to ensure transparency and accountability throughout the project. However, we are committed to not exceeding the agreed-upon budget of $900.\n\nI know you have a decision to make between us and other solution providers.\n\nHowever, what we create will look good and convert on Amazon. Ultimately you save a lot more in inefficient advertising if you have a healthy conversion rate on these listings.\n\nAlso, brands like you benefit from partnering with an agency that are experts on both creatives and advertising. That’s where we come in because once we create these A+ contents, we know exactly what strategies can help you with ads.\n\nIt’s only $900 for such a detailed scope, let me know if we are good to proceed. Looking forward to working with you.",
    "Q. If someone has no credit card system in place and they charge via invoicing, requiring clients to pay manually, how should they take payment over the phone?\n\nA. There are only two ways to do it.\n\n1. Have credit card payment method available\n2. ⁠Make payment the step prior to onboarding. So service only starts once confirmation of payment is received\n\nIt’s ok if you can’t collect payment on call. The idea is for them to make a decision on the call.\nIf they want to think about it, always try to book another call towards the end of the first call.",
    "Q. The majority of clients wanna stay on email communication instead of coming anywhere else other than WhatsApp. How should we handle this?\n\nA. For our project based clients, we keep them on emails. However, for our account based clients, we tell them slack is where we communicate but 15% clients still want to remain on emails.\n\nWe tell them the benefits of being on slack when doing onboarding",
    "Q. If the client doesn't use or agree to use Slack, ike most of our Pakistani clients, will you communicate on WhatsApp as well?\n\nA. Not recommended.\n\nEither they do emails or we move to Slack.\n\nWhatsApp is personal and business one is also not a solution because all users have one no and it gets chaotic\n\nPakistani clients are the toughest to deal with so if they are very hellbent on using whatsapp, i guess you can use it but try to discourage\n\nSlack has:\n- Integrations available especially with Zapier\n- ⁠All communication has docs/resources centralized in one place (you can use WhatsApp description but I’ve noticed people don’t use it much)\n- ⁠Better visibility for your team which means they can communicate with clients better\n\nWhatsapp is just disorganized.",
    "Q. For smaller brands with lower retention rate, what should we do if they don't show up to the audit report meeting?\n\nA. This won’t work unless they give you commitment on call. It will only annoy them.",

Yeah bring it up saying \"By the way, we have a referral program where we share x% of billing with our partners. Would you like to be set up for that since we’re getting these leads?\"",
    "Q. How do you guys manage client communication?\n\nA. 1- Tell them what's in it for them. How it will be beneficial for them.\n2- Tell them x is helping with your project and I think it would be better if he is also part of the communication.\n3- You need to clarify this to the client that for payment related questions they only need to talk to you. And tell your team they can’t chat outside of slack or in Private messages.",
    "Q. I usually get this situation on calls: \"I'm already scheduled to meet a few other people. I'll let you know once I'm done with interviews.\" How do we tackle them?\n\nA. Prospect: Let me think about it/talk to others\n\nYou: Absolutely, now before we hop off the call, what is it you wanted to go over/wanted to see from others before making a decision? That way i can send you some material that might be useful\n\n1. Prospect: Well it is the XYZ (This is the real objection >> Refer to Objection handling on how to tackle that)\n\n2. Prospect: Nothing really, just wanted to discuss with team/ talk to others/ do research\n\nYou: Sounds good. and when do you think you’ll have made a decision?\n\nProspect: Oh give me X days\n\nYou: Wonderful. Why don’t we book a quick follow up call for Wednesday (after X days pass). That way if you have any questions, we can discuss right away and i can get you through your onboarding\n\nThis is called BAMFAM >> Book a meeting, from a meeting",
    "Q. After presenting my offer and details at the end of a meeting, how long should I wait before sending a follow-up message?\n\nA. You should send an email after the meeting email as soon as possible. It leaves a great impression and is a good way to recap the call",
    "Q. If a client feels my pricing is high after I've already presented my offer, what percentage reduction is reasonable?\n\nA.  I wouldn’t reduce my price just because the client says it’s high.\n\nThat’s a tactic, not a reason.
