Because of this one thing, my company never hired talented people. I made the best HR team, but it didn't work out. Because the business owner knows who should be the top candidate for that job. But interviews take a lot of time, and some people are masters at answering questions. So what's the solution? Group interviews. Now I interview 4-5 people for each position, and I always ask this question.
If you had to leave yourself and hire someone else who would you select and why? This way I get other people's opinions and I can interview more people in less time This way I get other people's opinions and I can interview more people in less time.

if you want to be a highly productive business owner, then you must know that your personal relationships will be impacted. Your friends, your family, your close community with whom you are talking, they will take notice that you are busy and they will complain. But complaining is part of life and it and a part of Pakistani culture. So where complaints are coming from, it's okay. You just have to stay committed and you have to understand that these relationships will have an impact. When these people see you successful, they will learn to realize that your time is really important. And people will not bother you much, but at the same time, whenever you talk to them,

they'll know that they've spent their busy time for me. they'll know that they've spent their busy time for me. It will be a lot more meaningful that way.

Today, a superstar left my company. And the sad part is that after 4 years, he took all that experience with him. This reminds me of my previous boss, that you are not the owner of someone's time, you can only borrow their time until they work for you. The good employees don't actively look for jobs,
companies look for them. Their CV and attitude speaks for themselves. Because you can't stop them forever. But you can definitely train the backup on the other number. And training will be done by your superstar. It just has to make video SOPs that you have to give to your backup. Goodbyes do not have to be messy, even if they are leaving, goodluck positively.

"morning this is sad I'm calling it from HOS this is a cold call by the way I just wanted 30 seconds we are a company that primarily does video production I'm calling to see if you guys are looking for any help?"
" as of now, no"
"would that be because you think everything is going amazing then I'll be on my way is it because the random cold quality"
"In a way that is sorted out right now, you can just drop a portfolio of your company or email. "

 Can I come in and shoot one video which will cost you nothing and give you the most amazing engagement? "
"Sure, I wouldn't mind that. Just drop me an email with it. "
"This whole idea of sending a portfolio without context doesn't help anybody. So instead of doing any of that, we love to get on a call which helps me understand what "

Saad is a cold calling a master and I had videos i have watched before. Right away said it was a cold call. Can I get 30 seconds? She said, no, he didn't really push back. He acknowledged which lowers sales card a bit.

And instead of asking I'll send an email, he offered like a free video, which is an amazing lead magnet. The only thing that I would change is the tonality. When she asked to send email again, So Saad said, the whole idea of sending a portfolio through email is not helpful. Instead what I would say is, can we schedule a call instead? And the reason I asked that is because I can get more context on what kind of video you're looking for so that I can deliver a video that has more value. That would be the only change.

"How do you manage such a big team?"
YOur team is like your children, they look up to you and they want your attention. Be careful of who you give attention to.
if you waste all of your time and energy in correcting somebody's bad behavior, you will waste alot of time.
Instead, if you just ignore it and just celebrate winners, you will see a cultural shift. Because winners are self driven. They just need an impact, they don't need babysitting. And gradually, the backperformers, they also give up.

So marketing is that investment you make to make it a brand. Your agency won't make a brand if you only close client on the basis of your outreach and connections
So marketing is very important.
Last year, we spent $50M+ on conferences and $30M+ on Google ads. Other than that we have a whole social media team. There is a lot more things that happen. 
SO these investments don't shrink out profit margin. We are here to grab market share. You won't become a proper brand unless you rule out your competitors, and there will be an eternal competition for you.

To run an agency you sould have business sense. I will tell you your revenue distribution first
1. Cost of service: 30% of revenue- cost of team and tools to deliver the service

3. Sales: 10-15% - includes your closer costs, CRM costs, appointement settelments etc

SO your net profit is 30-40% of your revenue

Your profit won't be affected if your team is on commission basis.

"When you started, did people demotivate you? You won't be able to do it or things like that?"

It's been 7 years since i am doing this. Because my mentor used to tell me that if you have spent 7 years in an industry, you have certainly made your reputation.
In online world, you have to make effort to know things which others dont know. What, when and how to do a certain thing is very important
1. What to do: You can find easily on platforms online like youtube.
2. How to do: you will get to know by conferences, close groups, webinars etc
3. When to do, most important: for that: coaching and masterminds. Those people have already done it, you just have to reverse engineer it.

"How to convince a client on contract?"
If it is a recurring service, say "We have a set-up fee of $2,500. But if we sign a 6-month contract, the set-up fee is waved off"
if it's a project based service, say "We can do a test project for now, but our rates are going up. So why don't we talk about the next project. That way I can lock in the rate for you. "

The fact that the smaller agencies are not even able to take on brands which have 15-20 products. Work with the small guys first. You will learn from their challenges or just smaller accounts. So you can learn from them.
Like they are picky clients, no doubt.
Like initially we were on Fiverr and Upwork. Now we don't do that anymore. The smaller agencies should focus on the smaller guys because you guys are not sophisticated enough to handle the big guys. And once you become sophisticated enough, once you have a lot of smaller guys, then you will see these bigger guys, you send them 20-30,000 invoice, they will clear it instantaneously, they won't even ask. For them, it's just a budget.

I am in Bali and my agency has finished the mastermind retreat. 13 agency owners were there.3 of them were doing a $3 million dollar plus and the rest are over half a million dollars.
 So people are asking me why do agencies need knowledge at this stage. Meaning we should know everything by now So why do you guys do this retreat? 
 Look, the knowledge is something that small freelancers and small agencies need. They need to know what is possible in the market. But when you get to half a million dollars, you need to know lesser knowledge And you need to change a belief system.
 So there is this session is given to you which helps you unlock such things Which would give you exponential growth.
  Now there was an example of an agency owner who made a million dollar agency By getting clients from Facebook groups.
   Now my previous belief was that Facebook groups are saturated You can't scale through it.
   But even from Facebook groups, you can acquire as many clients that you can make a million dollar agency.
 Imagine that such things are unlocked for you That only happens in masterminds There is no such thing on YouTube or conferences .So this is why you need to be in that mastermind And our at least $30,000 revenue is generated.

It's all about communication. I had no background of graphic design or marketing or anything It's purely accounting.
 What I'm good at is sales If you bring a client in front of me, I can guarantee you that they will be closed.
 Whatever I quote them, they'll be closed. Because when they walk out from a conversation with me, they think I'm the absolute expert. And they respect me. Tell me how many youngsters leave such imapct when they walk out of a conversation?

Million dollar to tip to scale your agency: At some point in your business. you have to do less.
Look, initially, you provide many services. Saying yes to every client. All of this hustle bring you to max $50,000
but to reach $100,000, you can't waste your time on small services and side projects. You can get maybe an extra $4-5k but they will cost you as much time as will be needed for a $100k
For rapid scaling, pick a prime offer and scale it. something you are considered a specialist of. Notice, the very famous restaurants have a very selective menu.
You know what the restaurant is good at and they know what they have to deliver you. And this concept is mainly a game-changer. It's not necessary that I work on 10 businesses at once. But what I am working at should have a potential of $50-100k.
So if you are stuck at $2k a month, the reason could be that you are stuck at low-leverage activites.

As a youngster, you must focus on your soft skills. in you know how to communicate, that's most of it.
 Most of the people don't like to face camera, that's okay.Not Everyone has that aptitude.
  But what that does is, leads are coming to the. But they are not willing to jump on a call with the client either. 
Rule:1 Never close a client on email or text. Always get them on a call. Never give them a price from the get go. Make them back for the price at the end. 


=== Transcription for audio15.mp3 ===
All that matters to a client is that the work should be delivered to them on time with quality assured. If you are unable to do so, don't make excuses, just tell them upfront.

=== Transcription for audio16.mp3 ===
I'll advise the youngstersto go to observation mode. Don't do anything, just be in those groups, figure out what you like.
if have listed 20 services, internalize them, study them, see what your natural aptitude is towards.
Learn it properly then pair up with agencie, tell then you can do it for free for them.
"you know I just wanna learn I'm a student, I wanna learn,internship or whatever, just give me some experience."

"if i were to ask you a simple question to go to from a zero to a million dollars as you already are how much is it difficult and what to do what you have to do in your journey to be able to reach there?"
today if i ask a small agency on a very young stage:  "what do you do and why you?" they won't be able to give me an answer.
so work on that thing first. the second thing is really really important: Marketing- that's the core of it.
if you are not marketing how do you expect to build a brand? so you have to realize that at this this stage, you have to execute all this: service development, marketing, sales and operations  one step at a time .

Apple came to India with $1 billion super. In Pakistan, the whi=ole IT export is $2 billion.

India made a call center. Or, quite frankly, a call center was the best communication that they could train. So, it was much easier to train resources, train talent. So, it was .com. So, India had a good timing system.
when .com came, it was a great fear. If you remember, coding wasn;t done in 00's back them.
 And in 2000, there will be a glitch.  Software engineers had a high demand. And the IIT, inspired by MIT Orenco, had their own model and that they will bring them software engineers.
 And India had such a big surplus of software engineering talent. So, they invaded the .com bubble. So, they made a big difference.

I don't beleive the people who say making $50k a month is impossible without a degree. You do not need a degree or work experience, I myself have scaled my 3 agencies to $1M+ a year.
One more thing, I won't sell a person anything who thinks $50k a month is enough. You only make what you want to make.
Every video editor, ad specialist on upwork is earning mre than that. You have to trust people. Seeing people earn so rapidly on social media leaves you with only two opinions:
either everything on internet is fake or i will get to the top by the knowledge i gain through social media.
So you have to choose your direction

Cold emails are not dead. I have closed 5 clients in the past two months and have generated $9.5k revenue. Here is what you need:
1. Lead generation software, clay for our case.
2. After that, you need a software to send emails to those leads. we will use SmartLead. Don't use one domain for emails or all will end up in spam. you can send 30 emails a day using one domain.
3. Lastly connect smartLead with slack, so that as soon as you get the notification, you are able to follow up.

Implementation steps:
1. Create an email list
2. Warm up your domains, and gradually increase your volume.
3. Make 3-4 good templates. a good template contains three things: Personalization, social proof and soft question.
4. When they respond, send a Loom video with a small CTA to schedule a call.

"Okay, I'm looking at the listing and it looks like you have everything like what are we aiming to fix here? "
"So I'm not really ranking too well for some monster keywords. "
"So ranking is ultimately tied to your conversion rate and if I had to make the changes myself I would do the images and the video instead of the A+. "
"probably get it to 5% if we also work on reviews. It's not much, but with your margins, you should get like an ROI."

We live in a world where you cannot escape content creation. You have to create content, and you have to resonate with the audience that you're targeting. And if there is a conflict between two different industries that you're trying to tap into, people will just don't know the applications you guys were into. So at this stage where you're just starting to lay your foundation down, it's highly recommended that you focus on one thing.
When I talk about journey to $1 million, trust me on this, the less you do, the less you sell. Like in terms of offers, the more quickly you can scale. That's all it is. So just focus on one offer, focus on one audience, focus on one problem.
