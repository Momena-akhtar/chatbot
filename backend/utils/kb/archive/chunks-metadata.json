    "## Hiring & Team Management\r\n\r",
    "### Group Interviews\r\n- Conduct group interviews with 4-5 candidates at once\r\n- Ask: \"If you had to leave yourself and hire someone else, who would you select and why?\"\r\n- Benefits: Get other people's opinions and interview more people in less time\r\n\r",
    "### Managing High-Performers\r\n- \"Your team is like your children, they look up to you and want your attention\"\r\n- Be careful who you give attention to\r\n- Don't waste time correcting bad behavior; instead, celebrate winners\r\n- Winners are self-driven and need impact, not babysitting\r\n- Underperformers will gradually improve or leave\r\n\r",
    "### Handling Employee Departures\r\n- \"You are not the owner of someone's time, you can only borrow their time until they work for you\"\r\n- Good employees don't actively look for jobs; companies look for them\r\n- Create backup systems - have departing employees create video SOPs\r\n- Maintain positive relationships even when employees leave\r\n\r",
    "### Customer Success Managers\r\n- CSMs are bridges between you and clients\r\n- Designers, ad managers, and copywriters often lack client communication skills\r\n- Lower risk in hiring CSMs since they typically don't have their own teams or specialized skills\r\n\r",
    "## Scaling Strategies\r\n\r",
    "### Revenue Distribution\r\n- Cost of service: 30% (team and tools)\r\n- Marketing: 10-15% (ads, platforms, social media)\r\n- Sales: 10-15% (closers, CRM, appointment setting)\r\n- Overhead: 10% (rent, HR, accounting)\r\n- Net profit: 30-40%\r\n- Initially hire on project basis rather than full-time\r\n\r",
    "### Marketing Investment\r\n- \"Marketing is that investment you make to become a brand\"\r\n- Example: $50M+ on conferences, $30M+ on Google ads annually\r\n- These investments don't reduce profit margin but grab market share\r\n- \"You won't become a proper brand unless you rule out your competitors\"\r\n\r",
    "### Specialization\r\n- \"At some point in your business, you have to do less\"\r\n- Initially providing many services helps reach ~$50K\r\n- But to reach $100K+, focus on your prime offer as a specialist\r\n- \"Notice, very famous restaurants have a selective menu\"\r\n- Focus on high-potential opportunities ($50-100K) rather than multiple small projects\r\n\r",
    "### Business Growth Tips\r\n- Success requires staying in the game with focus (no shortcuts)\r\n- Study companies 2-3x bigger than yours and reverse engineer their strategies\r\n- The biggest challenge is uncertainty - stay committed\r\n- Focus on one offer, one audience, one problem: \"The less you do, the less you sell, the more quickly you can scale\"\r\n\r",
    "## Sales Techniques\r\n\r",
    "### Cold Calling\r\n- Identify yourself as a cold caller immediately\r\n- Ask for a brief time (30 seconds)\r\n- Acknowledge rejection without pushback\r\n- Offer free value (e.g., \"shoot one video which will cost you nothing\")\r\n- Focus on providing context rather than sending portfolios blindly\r\n\r",
    "### Cold Emails\r\n- Generated $9.5K revenue in two months with five clients\r\n- Requirements:\r\n  1. Lead generation software (e.g., Clay)\r\n  2. Email sending software (e.g., SmartLead)\r\n  3. Multiple domains to avoid spam (30 emails/day per domain)\r\n  4. Integration with Slack for quick follow-ups\r\n- Create 3-4 templates with: personalization, social proof, and soft questions\r\n- Follow up with Loom videos and calls-to-action\r\n\r",
    "### Client Retention\r\n- Always take payment upfront (deposit or partial payment)\r\n- \"Business breaks only when cashflow situation is disturbed\"\r\n- Work on pre-billing systems to retain clients\r\n- Deliver quality work on time; be upfront if you can't meet deadlines\r\n\r",
    "### Securing Contracts\r\n- For recurring services: \"We have a set-up fee of $2,500. But if we sign a 6-month contract, the set-up fee is waived\"\r\n- For project-based services: \"We can do a test project now, but our rates are going up. Why don't we talk about the next project to lock in the rate for you\"\r\n\r",
    "### Charging Higher Rates\r\n- \"Only the one who understands the goals of clients can put a price on the work\"\r\n- This is value-based selling\r\n- Rule: Never close a client on email or text; always get them on a call\r\n- Don't give prices immediately; make clients ask for the price at the end\r\n\r",
    "## Business Mindset\r\n\r",
    "### Mastermind Value\r\n- Small agencies need knowledge about what's possible\r\n- $500K+ agencies need to change belief systems\r\n- Example: Learning that Facebook groups can help build million-dollar agencies\r\n- \"Such things are unlocked for you in masterminds that don't happen on YouTube or conferences\"\r\n\r",
    "### Communication & Soft Skills\r\n- \"It's all about communication\"\r\n- Background in design or marketing not required if sales skills are strong\r\n- \"If you bring a client in front of me, I can guarantee they will be closed\"\r\n- Focus on communicating expertise and earning respect\r\n\r",
    "### Time Management\r\n- \"If you want to be a highly productive business owner, your personal relationships will be impacted\"\r\n- Friends and family will notice your busy schedule and may complain\r\n- Stay committed; successful people's time becomes more valued\r\n- Focus on resolving bottlenecks: \"What is the shortest lever you can pull to get the highest gain in business?\"\r\n\r",
    "### For New Entrepreneurs\r\n- Start in observation mode - join groups and see what you like\r\n- Identify your natural aptitude and learn it properly\r\n- Partner with agencies and offer free work to gain experience\r\n- Develop your unique value proposition: \"What do you do and why you?\"\r\n\r",
    "## General Advice\r\n\r",
    "### Education vs. Skills\r\n- University degrees are overrated considering time investment\r\n- Focus on developing high-demand digital skills\r\n- You can scale agencies to $1M+ without formal education\r\n\r",
    "### Content Creation\r\n- \"We live in a world where you cannot escape content creation\"\r\n- Create content that resonates with your target audience\r\n- Focus on one thing when starting out"
